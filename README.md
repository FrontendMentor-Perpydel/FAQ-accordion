## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/guide/) - For styles

### What I learned

I was able to directly implement using SASS, using this simple FAQ accordion. I was able to make use of the modules and inheritance/extends the functionality of SASS, also the nested structure made it easy to implement CSS.

### Continued development

I am also working on the accessibility of this project in the aspect of adding keyboard navigation to the project.

### Useful resources

- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/guide/) - This helped me with figuring out how SASS works and how to configure it to be converted to Vanilla CSS so that it can be integrated into the HTML code.
